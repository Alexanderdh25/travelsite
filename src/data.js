After sunset, you'll see why this must-visit destination in France is known as the City of Light: The Eiffel Tower puts on its own dazzling light show every hour on the hour after dark.",

The Acropolis Museum also merits a stop, as it's filled with priceless antiquities and statues unearthed from what is known as the Acropolis Rock. Plan your visit in the shoulder seasons of spring or fall for cooler weather and fewer tourists.",
